We introduce a novel methodology that identifies similarities between diseases in which we train a classifier on single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data that distinguishes between individuals that have one disease and a set of control individuals and then use the classifer to classify individuals with a second disease and apply the method to reveal the known genetic similarity between type 1 diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis and a new putative similarity between bipolar disease and hypertension.
