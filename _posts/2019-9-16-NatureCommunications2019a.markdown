We performed a genome-wide non-coding screen for essential CTCF sites in chromatin loop anchors in the K562 leukemia cell line and discovered that the dominant source of signal in our screen was not due to deregulated gene expression but was instead consistent with CRISPR-Cas9 off-target activity causing reductions in cell fitness, despite filtering the single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) to have no perfect or 1-mismatch off-target sites.
