We developed a new approach to identifying the binding motifs of individual DNA binding domains of a transcription factor through analyzing chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing experiments in which a single DNA binding domains is mutated and applied it to identify the known binding preferences of CTCF zinc fingers 3–11 as well as a putative GAG binding motif for zinc finger 1.
