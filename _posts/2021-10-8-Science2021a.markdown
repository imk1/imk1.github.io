We used synaptic differences to excite parvalbumin-expressing external globus pallidus (GPe) neurons and inhibit lim-homeobox-6â€“expressing GPe neurons simultaneously using brief bursts of electrical stimulation and found that, in dopamine-depleted (DD), circuit-inspired DBS provided long-lasting therapeutic benefits that far exceeded those induced by conventional DBS.
